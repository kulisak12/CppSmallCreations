# CppSmallCreations
- Repository for many small, mostly one-file C++ creations

This repository is used for all small programs which do not need to be treated as a separate project. They mostly include programming challenges, problem solving programs and text file generators.
The main approach is to design clean, clever and easy-to-edit programs.
